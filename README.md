## Purpose of the application
The design of the application came from an often-overlooked Easter Egg in Google Chrome is the dinosaur game, which appears when you try to visit a website while disconnected from the Internet. The game can be play online at https://elgoog.im/t-rex/ . But, to celebrate its brilliant simplicity, i am going to add speech recognition to control the player.

## Gesture identification and consideration

## Gesture implementation

The reason I opted for speech recognition was because of the hands-free nature of speech interaction may offer advantages in the adaptation of games for learning. Because speech is a typically unused input channel during traditional arcade gameplay, speech interaction could enable users to keep up with the original game speed more so than text input. [6]

## Hardware

![Speech](https://i.imgur.com/7HF0B8S.png)

```
Windows Speech Recognition is a speech recognition component 
developed by Microsoft for Windows Vista that enables voice 
commands to control the desktop user interface; dictate text 
in electronic documents and email; navigate websites; perform 
keyboard shortcuts; and to operate the mouse cursor.
```


## Conclusions & Recommendations
***Conclusions***
Throughout the course of this project I learnt a lot, I should have researched more about what resources were available for the potential hardware I was going to use and I spent a reasonable amount of time trying to get speech recognition working due to the lack of resources available online. Speech recognition is a good hardware and the fact that it is an ever-growing market means that it is unlimited when developing with it. 

***Recommendations***
My recommendations would be that during the research process, the main focus shouldn't just be on what the hardware can do; part of the research process should also look into what resource are available.
